		</h2>
        <p>Tetris was created as a final assignment for our course on object-oriented programming. Although some features vary from the original Tetris game, most fundamentals were implemented. This application was written in C++ and implements object-oriented designs such as the <strong>Template Pattern, Visitor Pattern, Decorator Pattern, and more</strong>. Moreover, the project implemented <strong>high-cohesion, low-coupling, RAII, and STL</strong> to perfect object-oriented design.</p>
